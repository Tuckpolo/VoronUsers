Not being a fan of the brutalist effect and acquisition challenges of the extrusion top hat that coes with V0.2, I set out with a couple goals. First to adapt the V0.1 Top Hat which feels more aligned with the Voron Design Mission and asthetic, and to bring in a cost effective lighting and camera support solution to the V0 family. 


Step 1 Print Your Parts.  

Notes:  
  + The lights and camera parts are in green in the BOM. All else are optional.  
  + Parts are designed for printing on a V0.  
  + I'm not affraid of using support. I don't understand the anethmea about them in this community.   
  ++They are used on the Front Logo to prevent curling.  
  ++They are used on the Camera Back so that 3 parts can be combined into 1.  
  + Front Logo, you need two, I made a varient for holding the ribbon cable.
  + The color of the camera pad is optional, my reccomendation is match the color of the mounting surface.
  + I'm still working out how to change the orientation of the STL's this picture shows you my intentions.  
  ++  More hexes are low.  
  ++  Support goes down  
  ++  Words are right side up  
  ++  Camera mounts high
